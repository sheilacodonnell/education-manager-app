# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Student.create([
    { first_name: 'Harry', last_name: 'Potter' }, 
    { first_name: 'Katniss', last_name: 'Everdeen' },
    { first_name: 'Han', last_name: 'Solo' }, 
    { first_name: 'Peter', last_name: 'Parker'}])
